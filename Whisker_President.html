								Timeframe: 20 weeks

								Team Size: 10
							</blockquote>
							<p>I was the production lead, technical artist, and a gameplay/systems programmer on a team of 10 people for a point-and-click management game about a cat president. I recruited and managed the team, led game design discussions, implemented gameplay, and designed and implemented shaders. </p>

							<h2>Production</h2>
							<hr>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/production.png" alt="" />
								<p>As production lead, I led semiweekly meetings, coordinating and checking in with team members both remotely and in person, as well as both synchronously and asynchronously. I managed a production schedule with trello and spreadsheets over the course of 6 three-week sprints.</p>
								<p>I pitched the game concept to recruit the team. At the end of each sprint I gave progress report presentations to peers and course instructors standing in as a publisher, with a vertical slice presentation at the 10 week mark. At the end, we presented a pitch for prospective publishers for marketing budget and further development.</p>
								<p>I was also in charge of the backend for launching the game on Steam.</p>

							<h2>Shaders</h2>
							<h4>Cel Shading</h4>
							<p>I created custom shaders to give the game a style that resembled political posters/cartoons using Unity's ShaderLab language. I used cel shading and a combination of different outline techniques, like utilizing camera-facing normals and the depth buffer.</p>
							<h4>Halftone Shadows</h4>
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/tiling1.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/tiling2.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/tiling3.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
							<p>I applied a halftone patterned mask to the shading to enhance the cartoony/poster style. The mask had an adjustable tiling factor that could be used to tweak how large the halftone dots should appear. Additionally, it scaled the tiling to create consistency over different resolutions and applied anti-aliasing. This effect utilized the advantage of the game having a fixed camera.</p>
							<h4>Real-Time 3D Smears</h4>
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pawsmear.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
								<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/slapsmears.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
							<p>(gif framerate slowed to make smears more visible)</p>
							<p>I created a real-time smear effect to accentuate the movement of the arm slams. This was accomplished in the vertex shader by keeping track of previous positions and rotations and offsetting with accounting for distance from the pivot point. I had it smear more on the backside of the movement, to create trails while still maintaining the front edge of the movement. The previous position buffer dynamically adjusted the delay based on the current framerate.</p>
							<hr>
							<h2>Particle Systems</h2>
							<p>I implemented some basic particle systems to add flavor and compliment the game&#8217;s other animations with dust particles.</p>

							</span><h2>Design</h2></p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/WP_prototype_1.gif" alt="" />
								<p>I led brainstorming and design discussions in meetings throughout the 20-week project covering almost every aspect of the game. Primarily, I focused on designing the behavior of the titular cat president and the systems with which the cat interacts.</p>
								<p>To do this, I helped design a series of lo-fi physical prototypes for quickly and cheaply playtesting game concepts. These in particular were a lot of fun.</p>
								<h3>Implementation</h3>
								<p>In the Unity engine, I implemented the catâ€™s arm and head movement, as well as the functionality of interacting with the papers (picking them up, stamping them) using C#.</p>
